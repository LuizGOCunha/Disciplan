## WELCOME TO DISCIPLAN!

Disciplan is an application all about organizing and tracking your day to day life.
It gives you the power to create tasks and rate them on a difficulty scale. These tasks will then be attached to hours of the day, yielding points everytime a user confirm that it was completed successfully.
The total points will be shown in the profile, and will also be tracked in each individual day. That way
a user can see a graph of their own personal growth.
